Contributing to Documentation
=============================

InstrumentControl documentation is done 100% with Sphinx. Source files should
be added to doc/source. Invoke the Sphinx build script by calling:

doc/make html

The make.bat file simulates using Make on windows. You can also use:

doc/make clean 

to clean up existing documents and force a rebuild.

Using Documenation
