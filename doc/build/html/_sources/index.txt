Lab Instrument Control and Automation Framework
===============================================

The InstrumentControl project is a comprehensive solution for lab instrument 
control and automation. With an easy-to-use and fully documented API, 
InstrumentControl is all you need to develop robust scripts and applications 
to automate testing involving lab instruments. With this framework, you will 
no longer have to worry about interfaces and protocols. Instruments are 
abstracted as simple Python objects, no matter where they are on the network.

This project is a work in progress. Due to the nature of lab instruments, 
drivers must be developed to fully utilize the features unique to each 
instrument. Therefore, this framework cannot possibly hope to have a 
comprehensive list of drivers for every device on the market. This 
documentation includes everything a developer would need to write drivers for 
new instruments. Developers are encouraged to contribute their drivers to the 
project.
